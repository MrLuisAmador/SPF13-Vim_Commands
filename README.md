#Spf13-Vim Keyboard Commands/Shortcuts

This is my public reference of the keyboard commands/shortcuts that will help you quickly be productive with [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim).
This is for people wanting to make the switch from **Sublime Text** to **Vim**. My goal is to be able to reference all of the popular 
shortcuts that we use with Sublime Text and display how to do them with spf13-vim.

FYI, All of this information can be attained by searching for the **README** file of each installed plugin of spf13-vim. You will
also have to be familiar with using **Vim**, so come back once you feel comfortable with Vim and your wrist will thank you in the future.

##Vim Command Mode

I consider this the command palette of **Vim**. There is too much to document on the command mode, so once again, Iâ€™m only going to display what I feel is in comparison to 
Sublime Text.
