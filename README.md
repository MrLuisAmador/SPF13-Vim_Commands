#Spf13-Vim Keyboard Shortcuts

This is my public reference of the keyboard shortcuts that will help you quickly be productive with [spf13-vim].
This is for poeple wanting to make the switch from **Sublime Text** to **Vim**. My goal is to be able to reference all of the popular 
shortcuts that we use with **Sublime Text** and display how to do them with [spf13-vim].

FYI, All of this information can be attained by searching for the readme file of each installed plugin of spf13-vim. You will
also have to be familiar with using **Vim**, so come back once you feel comfortable with **Vim** and your wrist will thank you in the future.
